Description: 1) Data transformation for meta-analysis of microarray Data:
                 Transformation of gene expression data to signed probability scale (MCMC/EM methods)
             2) Combined differential expression on raw scale:
                 Weighted Z-score after stabilizing mean-variance relation within platform
